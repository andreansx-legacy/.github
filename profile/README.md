  <p>Welcome. This organization serves as an archive for my legacy projects, helping to maintain a streamlined organization of my GitHub account.</p>
  <p>Please note that the projects are outdated school assignments.</p>
  <p>I moved those repositories here, to clean out my GitHub profile from projects that are not in my field of work.</p>
